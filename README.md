# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: **Brandon Evangelista**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com/~prework-brandonevangelista...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!** added text remind player that this is a test of one's might**

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
[ -Mozilla Developer Network (this resource provided with amazing documentation on how to properly use syntax for each language.)

-Stack overflow (this helped me see how some functions were used in different situations)]


2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
[	The JavaScript tutorial about how to set up sounds was all new to me. I have never really played around with the frequency syntax. It was very scary but at the same time very very fascinating. A lot of the provided practice code look foreign to me. In order for me to NOT get lost in my own code, I needed to do some research! There are so many amazing resources out there on the web.
	The most challenging thing was learning how to take in all the information and laser focus on the most important. I found that there is an ABUNDANT amount of information to help me achieve my goal/project. In addition, there are hundreds of ways to write code that achieve the same product. Some are very efficient, but some are long and very human friendly.
My code was very easy to read (for me at least), and I was able to make my code run with no issues. If I didn’t know the answer to something looking it up was the way to go!  Learning about my resources and utilizing them to the fullest is what helped me the most.  Being able to humble thyself is a very strong skill to have. Saying the words “I don’t know” is a part of the job description. This never-ending (for)loop of learning something new is what I love about coding. I have only scratched the surface!

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
[There is so much that I don’t know. I feel that my code is very repetitive. In some stack overflow instances, I would have given a SUPER long code solution. Some users were able to what I do in less that 5 lines of code. I want to be able to make my code more efficient! With smaller projects like this, many lines of code don’t really affect the final product and how it performs. But if we apply the same methodology to a larger company/service, it is very taxing on the systems and overall not scalable. How can I make my code more efficient, but still easy to read for us Humans?  ]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
[I would love to add background music that also speeds up with the game. I would love to make it also mobile friendly! I feel that mobile devices have changed the way we develop, and majority of users are probably going to be on their phones anyways! Not only would I want to create a friendly and responsive app, I would also want this app to be useable for people with slower bandwidth/slower processing speeds.  I feel so blessed to be able to have access to AMAZING internet speeds. But the reality is that more than half of the world’s population barely has DECENT internet. On top of that about a third of the world is offline. So, designing applications with that in mind is truly a noble cause. An accessible internet is a better internet!]
